Getting Started
===============

teqp is a C++-based library with wrappers. The documentation is based on the Python wrapper because it can be readily integrated with the documentation tools and can be auto-generated at documentation build time.

The library can (for Python) be installed with:

.. code::

   pip install teqp

as the binary wheels for all major platforms are provided on pypi.
